# FIFA-20-Stats-and-Analysis-

Libraries I've used for this:
Pandas
Numpy
Seaborn
Plotly

The notebook contains some Player as well as Team Analysis and the results are plotted using visualization libraries like Plotly and Seaborn. Github performs a static render of the notebooks and it doesn't include the embedded HTML/JavaScript that makes up a plotly graph, so the graphs which are plotted using Plotly cannot be displayed in Github. 
To solve this issue, one nice option is to paste the link of GitHub notebook into http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/, which will present a rich view of the notebook.
